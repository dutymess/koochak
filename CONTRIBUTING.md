# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Koochak. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-Reporting a bug
-Discussing the current state of the code
-Submitting a fix
-Proposing new features
-Becoming a maintainer

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/peyman3d/koochak/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/peyman3d/koochak/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Submitting a fix or proposing new features
You can do this with this steps:
- Fork the repo
- Make your changes
- Push to your fork. Write a [good commit message][commit].
- Submit a pull request.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
